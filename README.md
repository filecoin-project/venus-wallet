[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ipfs-force-community/venus-wallet)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ipfs-force-community/venus-wallet)
![Go](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/venus-wallet/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

- a private key management tool
- an independent and brief business structure
- provide services such as private key management 
and data signing for local and remote calls via RPC or CLI.

---
### Get Started
#### 1. Build
```
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
export CGO_CFLAGS="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"

make 
```
#### 2. Setup 
```
# start daemon
$ ./venus-wallet run

# set password to protect wallet security (Used for AES encryption, private key, root token seed)
$ ./venus-wallet set-password
Password:******
Enter Password again:******
```

#### 3. Get remote connect string
> JWT Token restricts access to RPC interface calls
```
# --perm 
# "read","write","sign","admin" 
./venus-wallet auth api-info --perm admin
```

#### 4. Get strategy token
- Strategy token restricts the authority of business execution
- How to generate strategy token for remote service [Venus wallet cli](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-docs/blob/master/docs/zh/Remote-Wallet.md#jwt%E6%9D%83%E9%99%90%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86)
- URL append strategy token `<JWT token>:/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5678/http:<Strategy token>`



> Once we have a connection string, we can connect to the remote wallet through it.
